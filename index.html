                      >n October 2018, during an auction, Banksy activated a
                      shredder hidden in the frame of &#34;Girl with a
                      Balloon&#34; just as it sold for £1,042,000. The artwork
                      was partially destroyed in a dramatic performance that
                      left <br /><br />spectators stunned. People reacted with
                      phrases like &#34;we&#39;ve been Banksy-ed.&#34; This act
                      was widely interpreted as a critique of the
                      commodification of art and the fleeting nature of the
                      commercial art market.<br /><br />Ironically, most people
                      believed that the performance only increased the
                      artwork&#39;s value. Banksy was the first in art history
                      to realize such an audacious idea. The buyer of the
                      partially shredded piece chose to keep it, stating that it
                      was a moment that would go down in art history and
                      expressed delight in owning it.<br />The day after the
                      shredding, Banksy posted on his social media

                  <p class="p">
                    The day after the shredding, Banksy posted on his social

                    awareness of street art. Banksy&#39;s works address various
                    political, social, and artistic issues, delivering unique
                    perspectives and messages.<br />He never reveals his face
                    and creates art in secret, disappearing before anyone
                    notices. Only a select few have ever met him, primarily
                    through interviews. His artworks are officially recognized
                    as his only when they are unveiled on his website.
